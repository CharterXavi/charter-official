            <h2>Transitional Care Management</h2>
            <p>Transitional Care Management (TCM) is a program that provides services for individuals who need help during transitions in care from an inpatient setting (including acute hospital, rehabilitation hospital, long-term acute care hospital or skilled nursing facility) to the patientâ€™s home.</p>
            <p>A Transitional Care Specialist will visit you at the hospital or at home to explain the benefits of the program. Then a home nurse visit will be set up to evaluate your needs. The Program can help you:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Stay safe and stable at home to avoid unnecessary visits to the hospital</li>
                  <li>Set goals or your health</li>
                  <li>Prepare for your routine visit to your primary care doctor</li>
                  <li>Answer questions and concerns you may have regarding your condition</li>
                  <li>Learn about your symptoms and how to treat them</li>
                  <li>Teach you about your health condition and your medications</li>
