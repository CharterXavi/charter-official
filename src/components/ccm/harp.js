            <p>Transitional Care Management (TCM) is a program that provides services for individuals who need help during transitions in care from an inpatient setting (including acute hospital, rehabilitation hospital, long-term acute care hospital or skilled nursing facility) to the patientâ€™s home.</p>
            <p>A Transitional Care Specialist will visit you at the hospital or at home to explain the benefits of the program. Then a home nurse visit will be set up to evaluate your needs.</p>
