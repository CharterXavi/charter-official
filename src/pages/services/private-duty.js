            <p>
              Private duty home care is a service provided to individuals who need in-home support and assistance with day-to-day activities.
              A private duty caregiver is assigned to visit your home and help with daily living activities such as personal grooming, meal preparation,

              comfortably by customizing the services to meet the unique needs of each client.
