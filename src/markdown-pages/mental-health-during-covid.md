## How have you been feeling? 
Whether you're one of the millions of Americans who has tested positive for coronavirus or not, you've almost inevitably felt the effects of the pandemic. Your favorite stores, restaurants, parks, and more may have been closed for months. You and your loved ones and friends may be social distancing from each other leading to feelings of isolation. You may even find yourself feeling anxious every time you leave your house or apartment, and your concept of personal space may be changing as you attempt to keep your distance in public. It's safe to say it's been really taxing. As the <a href='https://www.who.int/teams/mental-health-and-substance-use/covid-19' target='_blank' rel='noopenner noreferrer'>World Health Organization (WHO) puts it</a>: fear, worry, and stress are completely normal reactions to times of uncertainty and perceived threats, i.e. an illness that is spreading quickly and taking many lives around the world. 

Our goal here at Charter isn't to stress you out further by highlighting the gravity of this public health crisis - instead, we're hoping to level with you in admitting something: this has been a difficult time, and that's okay. It's okay to have felt down this year, it's okay not to feel like yourself, and it's okay to admit that COVID19 has felt overwhelming at times. After all, we've been removed from the comfort of our preferred routines and tossed into a new reality ridden with change: economic change, social and cultural change, political change, day-to-day routine change, and more. This isn't easy stuff, so don't beat yourself up if it's all weighing you down. 

Now that we're on the same page and feeling reaffirmed, let's talk about some practical ways to cope with what we're all feeling during this time. 

#### Coping with the stress
It's so important to combat your stress with healthy coping mechanisms. Healthy coping skills help us build up resilience, which is a term in psychology used to describe our ability to "bounce back" from difficult experiences throughout the twists and turns of life. Let's dive into some ways to build and exercise your resilience during this pandemic and its many challenges. 

1. **Stay connected to your support systems.** This will inevitably look different these days as we keep each other at 6-feet away and beyond, but it's important to find alternative ways to stay connected to your friends and loved ones. Phone calls, video chats, and more allow you to exercise social coping that can be crucial in building up your resilience to tough times. Talk to those you trust about how you're doing, and be a listening ear for them too. Joke around and share some laughs with your friends and family. Provide each other encouragement and support. We are social beings and plugging into that by leaning on our support systems is a powerful, healthy way to fight stress in our lives.  
<br/>

2. **Nourish your body.** It's easy to forget, but your brain is a part of your body. Supplying it with quality nutrition helps it perform at its best, which is crucial in times like these where we may feel mentally taxed from worry and excessive thought. Eat well and keep your mind and body in great shape. Don't forget to exercise, stretch, and practice good sleep hygiene. Avoid unhealthy dietary habits like alcohol and drug use - remember, the goal is to nourish your body and mind!  
<br/>

3. **Nourish your mind.** Diligently consuming healthy food is important, but you'll also want to be sure to consume quality information, rhetoric, and interactions. Fueling your brain with encouragement and positivity can be a powerful way to build resilience, while feeding it with negativity and exposing it to things that dampen your mood can hinder resilience. This doesn't necessarily mean you have to ignore certain difficult realities, but be aware of the extent to which you subject yourself to these things. It's okay to take a break from the news and social media. Allow yourself time to breathe, rest, and recuperate. Spirituality is also an important part of mental health for many people, so feel free to practice meditation, prayer, or your religious practice of choice. The point is to connect to your sense of purpose and practice mindfulness, regardless of what that looks like for you.  
<br/>

4. **Stay informed.** At the core of much of our stress is a perceived lack of control. It's stressful to feel as though you have little or no control over a situation, especially one in which you or your loved ones may be in danger. One way to help fight this is to control what you can. Stay up to date and informed on COVID19 progressions, public health mandates and recommendations, information from your trusted providers, and research. Arming yourself with knowledge minimizes the amount of "unknowns", giving you more control over the situation. You will likely feel less stressed as you feel more prepared and aware of the state of the pandemic. Throughout this process, be sure to circle back to item number 3 in this list - you don't want to overload yourself! Be cognizant of where you obtain information and be sure to be reasonable with yourself. Stay up to date but don't be afraid to take a step back to catch your breath.   
<br/>

5. **Have fun.** It's easy to feel like there's no time for play in a pandemic, but finding ways to continue seeking joy and fun is important for your mental health. Engage in activities that you love. Don't let your hobbies fall by the wayside. Learn new things, build new skills. Not only can these things be enjoyable, but they can also help contribute to your sense of self-efficacy. Both of these effects are helpful for building strong resilience. As long as what you're doing adheres to social-distancing and public health recommendations, you can still have fun.  
<br/>

6. **Don't be afraid to seek help.**  Whether these items have helped or not, you may still feel the need for more serious help. Additionally, millions of people went into this pandemic with preexisting mental health conditions. The ability to seek out professional help is an act of bravery and whether you came into the pandemic with a mental health condition or not, you should never feel ashamed of seeing a therapist, physician, etc. for help with your mental health. There are many treatments available to help you fight stress and build resilience, and there are many health care providers available to guide you through those treatments and determine what would work best for you. 


#### Keep on fighting! 
Hopefully now you feel a bit more equipped to navigate the challenges of these complicated times. Resilience is something inside of all of us, that we practice day after day unknowingly, so we hope you understand that you have the power to harness that resilience and make it through whatever lies in front of you. Rest assured too that we are all right there with you, learning to cope with the weird times we find ourselves in. We can all get through this together.
