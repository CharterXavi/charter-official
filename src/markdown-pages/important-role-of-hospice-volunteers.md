Navigating the post-acute care journey is a lot easier when you have a supportive team at your side to ensure the most meaningful and comfortable experience possible. Volunteers play an important role in caring for hospice patients by providing companionship and support. Hospice volunteers spend their time talking with and listening to patients, reading aloud, offering companionship, helping them do things they enjoy like crafts or playing games, and much more. They can offer relief to family caregivers by providing them with reassurance that their loved one will have someone there for them. 

Charter Healthcare is fortunate to have many wonderful volunteers assisting patients across the states it serves. This National Volunteer Month, we highlight just a few of our exemplary volunteers who go above and beyond to enhance the lives of patients and provide a sense of relief for loved ones.

Helen has been a hospice volunteer for 17 years. Drawing on her many years of service, Helen now organizes the production of monthly patient gifts. She has come to know the talents of the other volunteers and utilizes everyone’s strengths to plan their monthly projects. She also makes lap robes to distribute to Charter hospice patients during the holidays. 

Helen loves what she does and encourages others to get involved in volunteering. “We invite others to our meeting so they can see what we do and how much fun we have doing things for others,” she says. “Even when someone says they are not crafty, we find just the right thing for them to do that makes them feel good about themselves and helps others.”

##### Anthony Fisher, Moreno Valley, CA

Anthony began volunteering at Charter Hospice three years ago to pursue his passion for medicine and build skills that would complement his desire to become a neurosurgeon. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, he would visit with patients and talk with them about their lives and accomplishments. When isolation measures became necessary he transitioned to virtual visits to maintain contact with patients and help to combat the loneliness that resulted from prolonged separations from family and friends. “We want patients to know their lives are valuable and we care about them,” Anthony explains. “Volunteering is important because it provides patients with companionship and the necessary social interactions to continue to find those happy moments in life.”

##### Carolann Stephens, Moreno Valley, CA

Carolann was inspired to become a hospice volunteer after her husband passed and she moved to southern California to be closer to her family. She has volunteered with Charter for 13 years, working in the office, visiting patients and family members, assisting with training of high school volunteers, working on monthly craft gifts and more. 

“Volunteering is very satisfying,” says Carolann. “You need to be a good listener and allow a patient to reminisce. They want someone to share their stories with and someone to share their laughter and their tears. The things a volunteer learns in the time they spend with a patient are a treasure.”

Aavaisara’s attention to detail is particularly valuable when she engages with patients in person and over Zoom. Aimal’s compassionate demeanor and exceptional listening skills have made her a trusted confidante among many patients. Noor’s kindness and receptive demeanor sets patients at ease and makes them feel comfortable. Their commitment to our patients makes a significant difference in their overall wellbeing and quality of life.
