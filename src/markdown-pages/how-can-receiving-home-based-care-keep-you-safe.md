##### How can receiving home-based care keep you safe?

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted many of the challenges older adults face in receiving safe, quality health care. The susceptibility of older adults to the virus has made it particularly difficult for those receiving care in assisted living or acute care facilities. 

Even before the pandemic, the majority of American adults expressed a preference to remain at home as they age. Now, as even more people stay home to lessen the chance of exposure to COVID-19, it’s more important than ever to understand the options for quality home-based care.

###### What is home health?
Home health offers a wide range of health care services delivered in the convenience and privacy of your home by specially trained health care professionals. It is often a more effective and efficient form of health care for people who have a chronic medical condition, disability, or are recovering from illness or injury. Because care is provided at home, the medical team can adapt to meet the specific needs of the patient and family, working to help maintain as much independence for the patient as possible. When administered properly, home health can often prevent or postpone the need for residential facility care or hospitalization and improve quality of life for the patient. Home health care is ordered by your doctor and covered by most insurances, including Medicare.

###### What is private duty home care?
Private duty home care is a service provided to individuals who need in-home support and assistance with day-to-day activities. Individuals can maintain the independence of living at home while receiving non-medical assistance from a private duty caregiver with daily activities such as personal grooming, meal preparation, housekeeping and companionship. 

###### Keeping you safe at home
The biggest concern loved ones and doctors often cite when considering home care versus a post-acute care facility is the ability for the patient to receive safe, quality care at home. Working with a respected post-acute care partner can help mitigate these fears. A post-acute care partner works with patients, doctors and family members to develop transitional care plans that minimize risk and meet patient needs.
