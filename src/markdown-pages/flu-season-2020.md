## Flu Season is here!
So far 2020 has been a year full of oddities, and most of us are probably experiencing a very different day-to-day than we're used to. Despite 2020 being a very abnormal year however, one thing is still inevitable: flu season. Luckily, as of this post's publication, the flu is barely active [according to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm). Preventing the spread of the flu is much easier than treating it, so while the incidence of the flu is still low we'd like to offer some tips (backed by the CDC's recommendations) to keep our patients and their loved ones happy and healthy!  



### How can you protect your health this flu season? 
There are a wide variety of things you can do to keep yourself protected against the flu, and participating in as many of these recommendations as possible can maximize your safety. 

1.) Get the yearly flu vaccine. Surely you've heard about the flu vaccine over the years, and most of us have probably gotten it at some point. What you may not know is that the yearly flu vaccine helps protect patients against the four influenza viruses that may be most common for the year based on [research across the entire planet on flu incidence](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine-selection.htm). It's no wonder that the vaccine provides powerful protection against the flu each season for millions of people around the globe, and getting vaccinated can be one of the most effective protections you can provide yourself. 

2.) Be diligent about hygiene and sanitation. This one's not rocket science but it's important to be especially cognizant during the flu season! Handwashing with soap and water, disinfecting surfaces regularly, and avoiding touching your eyes, mouth, nose, etc. with your hands can all do wonders in stopping the spread of the flu. If you'd like to take it a step further, see [this guide from the CDC on "everyday preventative actions"](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pdf/freeresources/updated/everyday-preventive-actions-8.5x11.pdf).

3.) Prioritize your health. Optimizing your well-being is a great way to stay healthy, and the flu season is a crucial time to be at your best. Exercise, a healthy diet, good sleep habits, and minimizing stress can all help build up your health and keep your immune system in tip-top shape. 

If you start with these three simple tips, you're already well on your way to minimizing your chances of a flu encounter. It's also important to lean on the advice of the medical professionals overseeing your care for further advice this flu season, so make sure you are participating in the existing treatment plans going into the flu season at your providers' recommendations.  
  


### But what if I still get the flu somehow?
Even when you take every precaution to avoid getting the flu, it's still possible to come down with it. If you find yourself experiencing flu-like symptoms (see [this CDC information](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/treatment/takingcare.htm) on signs and symptoms), be sure to contact your doctor and avoid contact with others in the meantime. Most flu patients don't need medical attention or antiviral drugs, but don't be afraid to seek them out if your condition is severe.  



### How will I know if it's the Flu or COVID19?
The flu and COVID19 are both viral respiratory illnesses, and because of that you may be wondering how to spot the difference. [This article by the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm) lists some of the similarities and differences, so feel free to read up on them there. If you are hoping to better identify the potential causes of your signs and symptoms, it may be helpful to consult your medical provider(s) and consider getting tested for COVID19.  



### In Conclusion
By following these tips and the advice of your health care providers, you are minimizing your odds of getting the flu. At the same time, you're also increasing your protection against COVID19 which will most likely remain a concern going into the flu season. Staying healthy and cautious during this fall and winter will be crucial in reducing the spread of both of these diseases, so arm yourselves with this knowledge and stay safe out there! From all of us at Charter Healthcare Group - we're rooting for you!
