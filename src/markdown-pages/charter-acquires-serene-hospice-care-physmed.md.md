Charter Health Care Group is now providing services to patients in six states with the recent acquisition of Physmed Home Health Care (“Physmed”) and Serene Care Hospice (“Serene Care”), both located in Omaha, NE.  The new locations recently reopened under the Charter Health Care Group name and retain all staff previously employed by both Physmed and Serene Care.  With these additions, Charter is serving more than 4,000 patients annually in six states.

Physmed and Serene Care have many years of success providing high quality hospice and home health care services to patients and their families in the Omaha market. This success is largely attributed to the loyalty, dedication and commitment of the staff. With this partnership, Charter is taking an initial step toward building a presence in the Midwest.
